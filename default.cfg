# Enabling Z3 fast requires at least Kickstart 2.0.

# Do not map Zorro II Fast RAM unless you absolutely need it, as Z2 address space is very limited.
# Cases where you may need Zorro II Fast may include emulating a 68000, 68010 or 68EC020, and/or if you are using Kickstart 1.3.

# Please take note:
# At the time of writing this (22 Jun 2021), the mouse and keyboard forwarding (for Amiga only) is by no means perfect.
# It works properly in Workbench, and in a number of games and applications, but it does not work for everything.
# Do not rely on the mouse and keyboard forwarding as your only means of input for the host computer.

# Forward keyboard events to host system, defaults to off unless toggle key is pressed, toggled off using F12.
# Syntax: keyboard [grab key] [grab|nograb] [autoconnect|noautoconnect]
#   "grab" steals the keyboard from the Pi so Amiga/etc. input is not sent to the Pi
#   (also helps prevent sending any ctrl-alt-del to the Amiga from resetting the Pi)
#
#   "autoconnect" connects the keyboard to the Amiga/etc. on startup
keyboard k nograb noautoconnect
# Select a specific filename for the keyboard event source.
# This is typically /dev/input/event1 or event0, but it may be event3 with for instance a wireless keyboard.
# Use ls /dev/input/event* to check which event files are available and try until you find the one that works.
#kbfile /dev/input/event1
# Forward mouse events to host system, defaults to off unless toggle key is pressed on the Pi.
# Syntax is mouse [device] [toggle key] [autoconnect|noautoconnect]
